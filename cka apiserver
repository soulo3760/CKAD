kubectl -n kube-system get pod  # get list of pods within the kube-system namespace 
Api server is the central control plane component that manages the state of the cluster.
it handles requests from kubectl client and others to perform
listing pods, creating deployments and scaling services.  
so if api server is not functioning correctly kubectl will be unable to communicate. 
so check api server logs 
check status of core compoenents such as api server k get pods - n kube-system
